##Histograms

Buckets: Observations are grouped into predefined intervals, allowing analysis of data distribution.
Aggregatable: Histograms can be aggregated across multiple instances, making them ideal for distributed systems.
Use Cases: Request durations, response sizes.

##Summaries

Quantiles: Summaries calculate percentiles based on individual instance observations.
Instance-Specific: Better suited for single-instance scenarios, as summaries cannot be aggregated across instances.
Use Cases: Memory usage, application-specific metrics.

##Key Differences:

Aggregation: Histograms aggregate across instances, while summaries are instance-specific.
Configuration: Histograms use buckets; summaries use quantiles.
Resource Usage: Summaries require more memory and CPU to maintain precise quantiles.
