Writing a Dockerfile smartly involves following best practices to ensure efficiency, maintainability, and security. Here are some tips:

1. **Base Image**: Start with a base image that suits your needs. It's better to use official images from Docker Hub as they are more reliable and secure. Use a minimal base image to keep the final image size small.

2. **Maintainability**: Include comments in your Dockerfile to explain what each command does. This will help others understand your Dockerfile and make it easier to maintain.

3. **Order of Instructions**: The order of instructions in a Dockerfile matters. Docker uses a layering system, and each instruction creates a new layer. If you frequently change parts of your Dockerfile, put those parts towards the end to take advantage of Docker's build cache.

4. **Multi-stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to keep your final image size small. In a multi-stage build, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile, and only the final image is pushed to production. This allows you to include tools and packages in your build environment that are not needed in the final image.

5. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for any values that are likely to change, such as database connection strings or API keys. This makes it easier to change these values without modifying the Dockerfile.

6. **User and Permissions**: Don't run your application as the root user if it's not necessary. Create a new user and switch to it using the USER command. This can help prevent security issues.

7. **Healthcheck**: Implement a healthcheck in your Dockerfile to automatically check if your container is still working as expected.

8. **Cleanup**: Clean up after installing packages to keep the image size small. For example, in a Linux-based image, you can use `apt-get clean` or `yum clean all` after installing packages.

9. **COPY vs ADD**: Prefer COPY over ADD. ADD has some features that are not immediately obvious, like automatic tar extraction and remote URL support, which can lead to confusion. COPY is more straightforward.

10. **.dockerignore**: Use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the build context, which can speed up the build process and reduce the size of the final image.


Sure! Here's a simple Dockerfile that follows the best practices I mentioned:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Switch to a non-root user for security reasons
RUN addgroup --system app && adduser --system --group app
USER app

# Set the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# Implement a healthcheck
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=3s CMD [ "python", "healthcheck.py" ]
```

This Dockerfile is for a Python application. It starts with a base image, sets some environment variables, creates a working directory, copies the requirements.txt file and installs the dependencies, copies the rest of the application code, switches to a non-root user, sets the command to run when the container starts, and implements a healthcheck.
