### Title: **AWS RDS Deployment with Automated Read Replica and CloudWatch Alarms Using Terraform**

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to automate the provisioning of an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) instance with a read replica, including a secure and scalable VPC setup. The infrastructure will include subnet configurations, security groups, and monitoring using CloudWatch alarms integrated with SNS for alert notifications. The goal is to ensure high availability, security, and performance monitoring for the RDS instance and its replica, following best practices for AWS infrastructure.

### Architecture:
1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
   - A custom VPC with both public and private subnets.
   - The public subnet hosts the NAT Gateway, while the private subnets are used for the RDS instance and its replica.
   - Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway configured for outbound internet access.

2. **RDS Instance:**
   - A MySQL RDS instance is created in the private subnet for secure database access.
   - The RDS instance includes Multi-AZ (Availability Zones) for high availability.
   - Security groups control access to the RDS instance, allowing traffic only from the necessary IP ranges.

3. **RDS Read Replica:**
   - A read replica is created for the primary RDS instance to offload read operations and ensure high availability.
   - Dependencies ensure that the read replica is provisioned after the primary RDS instance, VPC, and security group.

4. **CloudWatch Monitoring:**
   - CloudWatch monitors key performance metrics, such as replication status, CPU utilization, and database connections.
   - Alarms are configured to trigger notifications when thresholds for critical metrics are exceeded.

5. **SNS Notifications:**
   - Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is used to send email alerts when CloudWatch alarms are triggered.
   - Ensures proactive monitoring and quick response to any issues with the RDS instance or read replica.

6. **IAM Policies:**
   - IAM roles and policies grant the necessary permissions for managing secrets in Secrets Manager and accessing the RDS database.

### Components:
- **VPC**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.
- **RDS MySQL Instance**: Multi-AZ configuration with secure access through private subnets.
- **RDS Read Replica**: Automatically created after the primary instance, replicating data from the master for read scaling.
- **CloudWatch**: Alarms set up for key metrics like CPU utilization and replication lag.
- **SNS**: Email notifications for alerts from CloudWatch alarms.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Managed access to Secrets Manager and database services.
  
This architecture ensures secure, scalable, and highly available RDS infrastructure with robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms in place.
