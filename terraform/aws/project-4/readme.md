Project Title: "Multi-Environment Static Website Hosting with S3 and CloudFront using Terraform"

Project Goal:

Create a multi-environment (e.g., development, staging, production) static website hosting solution using AWS S3, with content delivered through CloudFront for faster global access, all managed with Terraform.

Project Components:

Here is the requested format:

---

**1) Create S3 Buckets for Static Website Hosting**

   **a) Create S3 Buckets:**
   
   i) Create separate S3 buckets for each environment (e.g., `my-website-dev`, `my-website-staging`, `my-website-prod`).

   **b) Enable Static Website Hosting for Each Bucket:**

   i) Enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.  
   
   ii) Set the index and error documents (e.g., `index.html`, `error.html`).

   **c) Configure Bucket Policies:**

   i) Set up appropriate bucket policies to make the website publicly accessible if required.  
   
   ii) For private access, restrict the bucket policy as necessary.

---

**2) Versioning and Lifecycle Policies**

   **a) Enable Versioning for All S3 Buckets:**

   i) Enable versioning on each S3 bucket to retain old versions of files.

   **b) Set Up Lifecycle Policies:**

   i) Configure a lifecycle rule to move older versions of files to a different storage class (e.g., Glacier).  
   
   ii) Optionally, configure a rule to delete old file versions after a certain period.

---

**3) CloudFront Distribution**

   **a) Create CloudFront Distributions:**

   i) Create a CloudFront distribution for each environment to serve website content from S3.

   **b) Configure Custom Domain Names:**

   i) Set up custom domains using Route 53 (if needed).

   **c) Set Up SSL Certificates:**

   i) Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to configure SSL certificates for HTTPS traffic.

---

**4) IAM Policies and Roles**

   **a) Create IAM Roles and Policies:**

   i) Define IAM roles and policies to manage access to S3 buckets.  
   
   ii) Restrict file upload permissions to specific users or services while ensuring content is publicly accessible via CloudFront.

---

**5) Logging and Monitoring**

   **a) Enable Access Logging:**

   i) Set up access logging for both S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions.  
   
   ii) Store the logs in a separate S3 bucket.

   **b) Set Up CloudWatch Metrics:**

   i) Monitor traffic and access patterns using CloudWatch metrics.


ACM Certificates and CloudFront
Global Certificates: ACM certificates issued in the us-east-1 region (N. Virginia) are considered global certificates. These certificates can be used with AWS services that require global certificates, such as Amazon CloudFront.

Regional Certificates: ACM certificates issued in other regions are regional certificates and can only be used with services in that specific region. For example, a certificate issued in us-west-2 can be used with services like Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) or API Gateway in the us-west-2 region.

Why us-east-1 for ACM Certificates?
CloudFront Requirement: If you are using Amazon CloudFront for content delivery, you must use an ACM certificate issued in the us-east-1 region. CloudFront requires global certificates, and only certificates issued in us-east-1 meet this requirement.


The origin_access_identity must be a valid OAI ID that you have created in your AWS account.


1) Enable S3 Server Access Logs

a) Ensure that server access logging is enabled on your S3 buckets.

- i) Server access logging helps you track requests made to your bucket, providing detailed access logs for security and monitoring purposes.

2) Use S3 CloudWatch Metrics

a) Enable default CloudWatch metrics for your S3 buckets to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

- i) BucketSizeBytes: Total size of the bucket.

- ii) NumberOfObjects: Number of objects in the bucket.

- iii) AllRequests: Total number of requests made to the bucket.

- iv) 4xxErrors: Client error metrics (e.g., 404 errors).

- v) 5xxErrors: Server error metrics (e.g., 500 errors).

- vi) FirstByteLatency: Time for the first byte of data to be received.

- vii) TotalRequestLatency: Total time it takes to complete a request.

3) Configure Event Notifications

a) Set up event notifications to capture specific S3 actions (e.g., object created, object deleted).

- i) Configure the notifications to trigger Lambda functions or other AWS services.

- ii) These services can process events and send data to CloudWatch for further analysis.

4) CloudWatch Alarms

a) Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor specific metrics for anomalies or performance thresholds.

- i) Set alarms for key metrics like request count, error rates, or bucket size exceeding a predefined limit.

- ii) Configure notifications to alert you via email, SMS, or other communication channels when an alarm condition is met.

5) CloudWatch Logs

a) Enable logging on specific S3 actions and send the logs directly to CloudWatch Logs.

- i) CloudWatch Logs will help you monitor and analyze access patterns, security issues, and performance metrics related to your S3 buckets.

6) Storage Class Analysis

a) Set up Storage Class Analysis on your S3 buckets to monitor the access patterns of your stored objects.

- i) This will provide insights into which objects are being accessed frequently and which ones are not.

- ii) Use CloudWatch to visualize and analyze these insights to optimize storage costs and improve performance.
