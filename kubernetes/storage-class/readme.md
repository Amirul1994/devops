Kuberenetes StorageClass
In Kubernetes, a StorageClass provides a way to describe the "classes" of storage available for use in a cluster. Typical characteristics of a storage can be the type (e.g., fast SSD storage versus a remote cloud storage or the backup policy for a storage). The storage class is used to provision a PersistentVolume dynamically based on its criteria.

Most Kubernetes cloud providers come with a list of existing provisioners.
•	storageClassName: Specifies that this PVC should use the standard StorageClass.
A corresponding PersistentVolume object will be created only if the storage class can provision an appropriate PersistentVolume through its provisioner. It's crucial to note that Kubernetes does not generate an error or warning message if this does not happen. In the next lab, we will mount a pvc to a pod.
Role of storageClassName: standard:
1.	Dynamic Provisioning:
o	When a PVC is created with a storageClassName, Kubernetes looks for a StorageClass with that name. If the StorageClass is configured to support dynamic provisioning, Kubernetes will automatically create a PersistentVolume that matches the PVC's specifications (e.g., size, access modes).
o	The standard StorageClass is a common default StorageClass provided by many Kubernetes distributions (like GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.). It typically provisions storage using the default storage provider for that cluster (e.g., Google Cloud Persistent Disk, AWS EBS, Azure Disk, etc.).
2.	Binding to Existing PVs:
o	If dynamic provisioning is not enabled or if there are existing PVs that match the PVC's requirements, Kubernetes will bind the PVC to an existing PV that matches the storageClassName, size, and access modes.
3.	Custom Storage Classes:
o	If you have multiple StorageClasses defined in your cluster (e.g., standard, fast, slow, etc.), the storageClassName allows you to specify which type of storage you want for your PVC. For example, standard might be a general-purpose storage class, while fast might be SSD-backed storage for high-performance applications.
Example Scenario:
•	If you have a standard StorageClass defined in your cluster, and you create a PVC with storageClassName: standard, Kubernetes will:
o	Check if there is an existing PV that matches the PVC's requirements.
o	If no matching PV exists, it will dynamically provision a new PV using the standard StorageClass.
The StorageClass and PersistentVolume (PV) in Kubernetes are not the same, though they are related. Here’s an explanation of each and how they are connected:
StorageClass:
•	The StorageClass defines how storage should be provisioned in a Kubernetes cluster.
•	It is an abstraction that allows you to define different "classes" of storage (like fast SSDs, regular hard drives, network storage, etc.) for your workloads.
•	The StorageClass also specifies which provisioner (like AWS EBS, GCE PD, NFS, etc.) to use and the parameters for that storage backend.
•	Key role: It tells Kubernetes how to create dynamic storage (PersistentVolumes) when requested by a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
PersistentVolume (PV):
•	A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage that has been provisioned either dynamically (via a StorageClass) or statically (pre-created by an admin).
•	A PV represents actual storage in the cluster (like a disk in AWS, GCP, or an NFS share).
•	The PV is bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), which is how pods request storage.
How They Are Related:
1.	Dynamic Provisioning:
o	When a PVC is created with a specific StorageClass, Kubernetes uses the provisioner defined in the StorageClass to dynamically create a PV that satisfies the PVC's requirements.
o	For example, if you create a PVC requesting 10Gi of storage with a StorageClass that uses kubernetes.io/aws-ebs, Kubernetes will automatically provision an AWS EBS volume of the requested size and type.
2.	Static Provisioning:
o	In static provisioning, an admin creates PV manually, and the StorageClass might not be used directly. The PV is pre-configured with certain storage parameters and later bound to a PVC that matches the requirements.
1.	Pod → PVC → StorageClass → PV:
o	A pod requests storage by creating a PVC.
o	The PVC refers to a StorageClass, which defines how the storage should be created (provisioner, parameters, etc.).
o	Kubernetes uses the StorageClass to provision a PV that satisfies the PVC's requirements.
If a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) requests 1 Gi of storage, Kubernetes will create a PersistentVolume (PV) of 1 Gi to satisfy the claim, provided that dynamic provisioning is enabled and a StorageClass is specified.
